### How to practise yoga balance board?

Whether or not you already practise yoga, to get started, you need a balance board, which you can find here, and learn how to keep yourself balanced by activating all the muscles in your body.

If you have never tried it and don't know how to do it, you can learn on your own thanks to the information in the article on how to get started with a balance board. Once you have achieved good stability, which is usually achieved very quickly, you can start experimenting with the positions you already know.

As in the practice of yoga, the advice is to use comfortable clothing and to stand on the balance board barefoot to get a perfect grip on the board.

One last fundamental parenthesis on yoga balance board practice: breathe! Yes that's right, it seems obvious, but it really isn't. In fact, people often forget to breathe properly and perform exercises in total apnoea. This remainder applies to both beginners and professional athletes.

With correct breathing, practice becomes smoother, more conscious and less tiring, and for athletes, performance levels improve. So, be sure to breathe.
